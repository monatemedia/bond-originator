# Bond Originator User Interface

Bond Originator is a project built as a lead magnet for bond originators, helping them attract more clients.

## Concept

The client wants a sleek and simple, but custom built, mobile responsive website to market their services to potential clients on the internet. 

The written copy for the website is content that I had written orignally for a facebook post explaining how to buy property. 

The website consists of: 
* an introductory landing page; 
* a mortgage calculator;
* two articles and; 
* a contact form.

## Technology Stack

This website is built with:
* HTML
* CSS with Tailwind CSS
* Javascript
* Python with Pandas and Streamlit
* Free .svg and .png picture files
